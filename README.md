- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Joe
- I am using this to compile and organize any technical projects I am working on, whether that is software, hardware documentation, or any ideas and projects that require experimentation and iteration.

- I am mainly interested in game development in all of it's facets, whether it be hardware peripherals and it's integration in gaming systems, or the actual development of the games themselves.

- I am not just interested in game development however, as I do have projects I want to do in modifying operating systems, web development, and general computer science.

- I am currently studying at Ontario Tech University as a mechatronics engineering student.
- I am currently working at the ACE Climatic Wind Tunnel as well as a support member for the facility
